# HelloWorld
this is my first repository and I wish there is a good trip.
I think the world is bigger than what I thought in some aspects.
I'm planning to learn something about deeplearning, which is my topic for the freshman's seminar.

# it has been a long time (9/17 2018)
now I should look back.

I did not finish what I want to do for the deeplearning seminar topic, and I am still very new. anyway, now I decide to start something new. I do not know how to do something, and I hope I would know what to learn and then be able to do what I want.

this would be a repository for my study code. and actually, it would be a way to practice git.
